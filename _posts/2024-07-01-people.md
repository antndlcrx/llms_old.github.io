### Humeyra Biricik (Co-organizer)

*DPIR Oxford University*

Humeyra Biricik is the co-organizer of the Oxford LLMs 2024 and a doctoral candidate in Politics at Pembroke College. Her research focuses on the relationship between political speech, populism, and democratic backsliding in Turkey, Hungary, India, and Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern countries. She primarily employs large language models and text analysis, along with other econometric analyses, to conduct her studies. She is the recipient of the joint scholarship between Pembroke and the Department of Political Science and International Relations. As a part of her scholarship, Humeyra coordinates a series of politics talks at Pembroke College, on a wide array of topics, including [local British elections](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/local-elections-and-beyond-panel), [the housing crisis](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/dpir-key-panel-discussion-address-uk-housing-crisis), [regulation of AI and democracy](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/towards-effective-regulation-ai-misinformation-and-democratic-challenges), and [machine learning methods used in political science](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/event/fall-machines-why-simple-models-work-disappointingly-well-and-what-do-about-it-politics). She is currently working on organizing writing workshops for undergraduate students in politics, to support women and ethnic minority undergraduates at Oxford University.

### Ilya Boytsov (Lecturer, Co-organizer)

*NLP Lead, Wayfair*

Ilya is an applied Deep Learning Scientist with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). He currently works as the NLP lead at Wayfair in Berlin. His main professional interests include information retrieval, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and generative AI. In addition to his applied research work, Ilya has extensive experience in teaching and public speaking. He designed lectures and machine-learning bootcamps for various audiences, including students, managers, and individuals without prior coding experience. Ilya was a speaker at several ML conferences in Europe, including [World Data Summit](https://worlddatasummit.com/) and [DSC Europe](https://datasciconference.com/). He is also a co-founder of the [Street Smart AI community](https://www.meetup.com/street-smart-ai-berlin-meetup/) in Berlin where AI practitioners share their knowledge of making ML&DS happen for real-life applications. You can connect with Ilya and read more about his research on his [personal website](https://ieboytsov.github.io/about-me.html).
